<usage>
python PoetryWriter.py <textfile> <numStanzas> <numLines> <numWords>

Special note
I changed the color of the text output for the usage message and the generated
poem. It made it easier for me to read the results. If this presents a problem
lines 148 and 149 can be commented out and line 150 can be uncommented

For the usage message, comment out lines 188 through 191 and uncomment line
192
